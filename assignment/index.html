    <h3>Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What is the different between the two? for loop vs for... in loop? How do you know which one to pick over? Referring to question 7.</li>
  <li>What is considered the parts available? Is it the supplyChanges or the partsNeeded?
    Right now I am assuming it is the supplyChanges; and leaving out partsNeeded. Referring to questions 8, please clarify.</li>
